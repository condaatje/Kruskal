// ========== Approach ========== //
// Step 3: Start to worry about space. how can we avoid 64gigs mem?
    // don't add edges above a certain weight. This can be tested for accuracy.
    // also can have a complete algo for this - loosen the bound if necessary (can't find a solution? run again with more relaxed boundary)

// Hint: note that the two algorithms discussed in lecture
// will always return a valid MST. If your programs cannot run to completion,
// then you know you have failed to find an MST. So if we eliminate vertices and
// the algorithm finishes, it didn't actually have to use the vertex it seems...

// vector is allowed, qsort is allowed.
// No pre-built hashtables, but you can make your own. Shouldn't have to though.

// Instructors say it's ok if the algo takes 10min+ to run. Just shouldn't take hours.
