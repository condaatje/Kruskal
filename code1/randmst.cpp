// This will require implementing an MST algorithm,
// as well as procedures that generate the appropriate random graphs.


// For each type of graph, you must choose several values of n to test.
// n = 128; 256; 512; 1024; 2048; 4096; 8192; 16384; 32768; 65536; 131072,
// and larger values, if your program runs fast enough.
// For each value of n, you must run your code on several randomly chosen
// instances of the same size n, and compute the average value for your runs.


// Plot your values vs. n, and interpret your results by giving
// a simple function f(n) that describes your plot.

// For example, your answer might be f(n) = log(n) or f(n) = 1.5âˆšn
// Try to make your answer as accurate as possible; this includes
// determining the constant factors as well as you can.
// On the other hand, please try to make sure your answer seems reasonable.





// ========== Approach ========== //
// Step 1: Create Graph Class
// There must be a method through which I can easily and efficiently create a random graph
// in each of the three manners
// How to represent/access vertices and edges?
// What's the fastest? What's the most space efficient? Which is more important?


// Step 2: ????
